The top wear clothing image classification system, developed using deep learning and a custom dataset, successfully categorizes images into kurthis, long tops, short tops, and t-shirts. Through meticulous data cleaning, augmentation, and the application of a CNN model with transfer learning (MobileNetV2), the system achieved a validation accuracy of 87.04%. The stable accuracy and loss curves indicate effective learning and good generalization. The robust inference pipeline, incorporating file type validation, blur detection, ImageNet-based non-clothing filtering, and confidence-based checks, ensures reliable predictions, This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to image classification from data preparation to deployment-ready inference.
